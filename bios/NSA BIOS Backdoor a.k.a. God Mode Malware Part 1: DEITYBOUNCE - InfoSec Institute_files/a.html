(including before installing any device drivers or connecting it to the network, etc)\r\n\r\nThose who have used TrueCrypt full disk encryption knows that it forces you to burn a rescue disk before using FDE. Since I don't want to waste a disc each time, I've always downloaded and used WinCDEmu to bypass that TC requirement.\r\n\r\nHowever, recently, (and I tried this on three separate occasions, each time totally starting from scratch) when I reformat,wipe and after reinstalling Windows on PC-A, I notice that when attempting to install WinCDEmu that right after I click install, I get a weird error stating that \"Microsoft Register Server has Stopped Working\" and details show a \"BEX\" error related to DEP, referencing WinCDEmuContextMenu.dll_unloaded\r\n\r\nI have made absolutely ZERO hardware changes, no BIOS or firmware upgrades. Every time I have used the exact same Windows 7 DVD-ROM to install the OS via the bootable disc, the disc itself is fine with no scratches. I have also consistently used the exact same version of WinCDEmu and checksum it each time to make sure there is no bit-rot or file integrity issues. I do the same for TrueCrypt and use the exact same version of TrueCrypt. As a matter of fact, since I've done the exact same procedure so many times and I know TrueCrypt will ask for to burn a rescue disk, the very very FIRST thing I do after a fresh install of Windows 7 is to install WinCDEmu 3.6 even prior to installing TrueCrypt itself.\r\n\r\nI even tried the SAME Windows 7 64bit DVD bootable disc on another computer (call it PC-B) that I have that is airgapped and never connected to the network at all, and used the EXACT same version of WinCDEmu resting on the exact same external usb storage medium with no problems and don't get the error messages.\r\n\r\nSo, my procedure is EXACTLY the same, nothing has changed. Prior to the suspected infection, I had at least THREE different times used the same procedure with the exact same software and on the exact same hardware configuration (PC-A) and never had any issues or errors.\r\n\r\nNow, after the interdiction, I still use the exact same procedure, exact same hardware, exact same software and yet I get the persistent error messages. As a means of test/control, I even tried the exact Windows DVD install disc and the exact version (checksum) of WinCDEmu 3.6 on TWO seperate computers, one that is airgapped and another one that is not airgapped and neither of them have any issues nor give the error messages.\r\n\r\nAnd on the infected machine, when I try to proceed with the FDE and encrypt the host protected area, it will not work. It seems to work but the next time I reboot the computer to do the \"test\", it does not recognize my password even though I am 100% sure the password is correct. In addition, the harddrive is a standard Seagate HDD, and this is all commodity hardware, but when I moutned the harddrive to a different machine, it would not correctly recognize it and I would have not been able to have access to it to clone the drive or extract any data. It seems to only work when mounted on the original device.\r\n\r\nThis is something I've never encountered before. Since I do at least a \"one pass zero\" to wipe the entire harddrive each time prior to reinstalling Windows, since there has been no hardware changes, and since I always install WinCDEmu prior to making any changes to the newly installed computer OS (prior to connecting to the Internet, or updating drivers, or installing any other application, etc) the only thing that can possibly explain this bizarro behavior is that I've been interdicted and attacked by an advanced persistent threat such as the NSA.\r\n\r\nScreenshots:\r\n\r\nimage.bayimg.com/0a91bdcdb399dbf4322f89582af86f3cf70998db.jpg\r\n\r\nimage.bayimg.com/b42874a45ecde2e24940d33511c7ba81a560e407.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would not have caught this had circumstances not converged:\r\n\r\n1) I am a bit OCD when it comes to reformatting computers. I tend to do it way more often than necessary. However, repetitive motion develops muscle memory. When you've been doing something Nth times, and on the Nth+1 and subsequently every time after that something has changed, you easily take note.\r\n\r\n2) After installing Windows 7 from the same DVD each time (for consistency sake) the first order of business is always to install WinCDEmu and then TrueCrypt 7.1a. Of course doing install I don't have any other usb or connections, the PC doesn't have even have wifi functionality, and no Ethernet cables are plugged in. I could see how I might have gotten an error message if I had messed around in msconfig/services.msc/gpedit.msc or had installed other software or had updated or installed firmware, BIOS, and operating system and software drivers, but none of these are the case.\r\n\r\n3) The really odd thing is this, seeing how I was unable to make a clone of the drive (even using hardware methods), as a test I mounted it to a different computer to see if it would let me install Windows 7 onto that harddrive. Using the boot-able Windows 7 disc, it would boot to the first initial Windows 'energy logo' screen (right before the screen where you choose to install or upgrade Windows, etc) and it would merely stay there for 60 seconds or more... just hang there and do nothing at all. Then when it finally got past that part, after at least about 60 seconds, it would get to the install/upgrade screen, I choose to do a fresh install, and it reports back to the disk is not bootable and that Windows can't be installed on this disc (even though it is recognized by Windows and in the BIOS).\r\n\r\n4) So on one of the tests, I got impatient and abruptly cut power to the computer while it was stuck at the Windows bootup screen (prior to the install/upgrade options screen) on that test computer, then the next time I power cycled it and tried to restart/ turn it on, it would not do anything at all, as if the BIOS was damaged or acting like had the power been cutoff during the flashing of a BIOS.\r\n\r\nHow is this possible? Can the DVD-ROM drive's firmware itself be infected? If there is a firmware malware on the infected HDD, and I mount it to another clean machine, and try to install Windows 7 from DVD (the DVD obviously can't be contaminated) how could it possible get the chance to jump from the harddrive or the harddrive's firmware onto the BIOS or other components of the other computer?","createdAt":"2014-09-20T00:44:21","id":"1790292928","thread":"3416541179","depth":0,"numReports":0,"isDeletedByAuthor":false,"likes":0,"isEdited":false,"message":"\u003cp>I have a desktop computer, call it PC-A that in the past I have on at least three separate different occasions reformatted from scratch (with at least a one pass zero using killdisk) the HDD each time before installing Windows 7 64-bit onto the PC-A.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The very first thing I would do after reformatting the PC and reinstalling Windows would be to install TrueCrypt 7.1a and then do a full disk encryption on it before doing anything else.

<p>Too bad this is valid for almost any system design 'out there'.  If 
Dell was more honest, they'd offer some kind of advice on detecting the 
exploits out of the systems (say, EPROM reader with clip-on 
[solderless]) adapter.  Wrong checksum = possibly infected.</p>

<p>I have a desktop computer, call it PC-A that in the past I have on at
 least three separate different occasions reformatted from scratch (with
 at least a one pass zero using killdisk) the HDD each time before 
installing Windows 7 64-bit onto the PC-A.</p><p>The very first thing I 
would do after reformatting the PC and reinstalling Windows would be to 
install TrueCrypt 7.1a and then do a full disk encryption on it before 
doing anything else. (including before installing any device drivers or 
connecting it to the network, etc)</p><p>Those who have used TrueCrypt 
full disk encryption knows that it forces you to burn a rescue disk 
before using FDE. Since I don't want to waste a disc each time, I've 
always downloaded and used WinCDEmu to bypass that TC requirement.</p><p>However,
 recently, (and I tried this on three separate occasions, each time 
totally starting from scratch) when I reformat,wipe and after 
reinstalling Windows on PC-A, I notice that when attempting to install 
WinCDEmu that right after I click install, I get a weird error stating 
that "Microsoft Register Server has Stopped Working" and details show a 
"BEX" error related to DEP, referencing WinCDEmuContextMenu.dll_unloaded</p><p>I
 have made absolutely ZERO hardware changes, no BIOS or firmware 
upgrades. Every time I have used the exact same Windows 7 DVD-ROM to 
install the OS via the bootable disc, the disc itself is fine with no 
scratches. I have also consistently used the exact same version of 
WinCDEmu and checksum it each time to make sure there is no bit-rot or 
file integrity issues. I do the same for TrueCrypt and use the exact 
same version of TrueCrypt. As a matter of fact, since I've done the 
exact same procedure so many times and I know TrueCrypt will ask for to 
burn a rescue disk, the very very FIRST thing I do after a fresh install
 of Windows 7 is to install WinCDEmu 3.6 even prior to installing 
TrueCrypt itself.</p><p>I even tried the SAME Windows 7 64bit DVD 
bootable disc on another computer (call it PC-B) that I have that is 
airgapped and never connected to the network at all, and used the EXACT 
same version of WinCDEmu resting on the exact same external usb storage 
medium with no problems and don't get the error messages.</p><p>So, my 
procedure is EXACTLY the same, nothing has changed. Prior to the 
suspected infection, I had at least THREE different times used the same 
procedure with the exact same software and on the exact same hardware 
configuration (PC-A) and never had any issues or errors.</p><p>Now, 
after the interdiction, I still use the exact same procedure, exact same
 hardware, exact same software and yet I get the persistent error 
messages. As a means of test/control, I even tried the exact Windows DVD
 install disc and the exact version (checksum) of WinCDEmu 3.6 on TWO 
seperate computers, one that is airgapped and another one that is not 
airgapped and neither of them have any issues nor give the error 
messages.</p><p>And on the infected machine, when I try to proceed with 
the FDE and encrypt the host protected area, it will not work. It seems 
to work but the next time I reboot the computer to do the "test", it 
does not recognize my password even though I am 100% sure the password 
is correct. In addition, the harddrive is a standard Seagate HDD, and 
this is all commodity hardware, but when I moutned the harddrive to a 
different machine, it would not correctly recognize it and I would have 
not been able to have access to it to clone the drive or extract any 
data. It seems to only work when mounted on the original device.</p><p>This
 is something I've never encountered before. Since I do at least a "one 
pass zero" to wipe the entire harddrive each time prior to reinstalling 
Windows, since there has been no hardware changes, and since I always 
install WinCDEmu prior to making any changes to the newly installed 
computer OS (prior to connecting to the Internet, or updating drivers, 
or installing any other application, etc) the only thing that can 
possibly explain this bizarro behavior is that I've been interdicted and
 attacked by an advanced persistent threat such as the NSA.</p><p>Screenshots:</p><p><a href="http://image.bayimg.com/0a91bdcdb399dbf4322f89582af86f3cf70998db.jpg" rel="nofollow">image.bayimg.com/0a91bdcdb399d...</a></p><p><a href="http://image.bayimg.com/b42874a45ecde2e24940d33511c7ba81a560e407.jpg" rel="nofollow">image.bayimg.com/b42874a45ecde...</a></p><p>I would not have caught this had circumstances not converged:</p><p>1)
 I am a bit OCD when it comes to reformatting computers. I tend to do it
 way more often than necessary. However, repetitive motion develops 
muscle memory. When you've been doing something Nth times, and on the 
Nth+1 and subsequently every time after that something has changed, you 
easily take note.</p><p>2) After installing Windows 7 from the same DVD 
each time (for consistency sake) the first order of business is always 
to install WinCDEmu and then TrueCrypt 7.1a. Of course doing install I 
don't have any other usb or connections, the PC doesn't have even have 
wifi functionality, and no Ethernet cables are plugged in. I could see 
how I might have gotten an error message if I had messed around in 
msconfig/services.msc/gpedit.msc or had installed other software or had 
updated or installed firmware, BIOS, and operating system and software 
drivers, but none of these are the case.</p><p>3) The really odd thing 
is this, seeing how I was unable to make a clone of the drive (even 
using hardware methods), as a test I mounted it to a different computer 
to see if it would let me install Windows 7 onto that harddrive. Using 
the boot-able Windows 7 disc, it would boot to the first initial Windows
 'energy logo' screen (right before the screen where you choose to 
install or upgrade Windows, etc) and it would merely stay there for 60 
seconds or more... just hang there and do nothing at all. Then when it 
finally got past that part, after at least about 60 seconds, it would 
get to the install/upgrade screen, I choose to do a fresh install, and 
it reports back to the disk is not bootable and that Windows can't be 
installed on this disc (even though it is recognized by Windows and in 
the BIOS).</p><p>4) So on one of the tests, I got impatient and abruptly
 cut power to the computer while it was stuck at the Windows bootup 
screen (prior to the install/upgrade options screen) on that test 
computer, then the next time I power cycled it and tried to restart/ 
turn it on, it would not do anything at all, as if the BIOS was damaged 
or acting like had the power been cutoff during the flashing of a BIOS.</p><p>How
 is this possible? Can the DVD-ROM drive's firmware itself be infected? 
If there is a firmware malware on the infected HDD, and I mount it to 
another clean machine, and try to install Windows 7 from DVD (the DVD 
obviously can't be contaminated) how could it possible get the chance to
 jump from the harddrive or the harddrive's firmware onto the BIOS or 
other components of the other computer?</p>

<p>The BIOS on those Dell servers is almost certainly legacy. It took them a little while to switch to UEFI.<br>The
 assumption of a 1MB flash part might be right. Larger parts are 
routinely in use for BIOS today, but they use a chipset feature called 
descriptor mode on Intel platforms to share the part for multiple 
components on the system (such as the LAN controller). <br>UEFI secure 
boot would likely have stopped this dead in its tracks. PCI device still
 have option ROMs, but they are executable images that follow the UEFI 
driver model. And with secure boot enabled, they must be signed. It 
would be interesting to learn of any weaknesses in the signing process 
though. <br>The same goes for the boot loader used by the OS for IPL. 
It's not in wide use yet and the public has been mistrusting of it (the 
argument is that the system could theoretically be used to lock out 
certain OSes by an OEM being payed by a competing vendor, but that's an 
issue that should have been addressed by now).<br>The switch to UEFI, at
 least for Intel based systems should be pretty much complete at this 
point. I'm not sure about AMD platforms. Has anything that targets UEFI 
specifically come to light?</p>

<p>SneakerNet is not a program term (thus no capitals) but a slang term 
of the movement of data by physical means, as you mention. More 
interestingly, the term is typically used when referring to moving data 
between networks of different classifications.</p><p>For example, "this

 need to email it. I ought to SneakerNet it down to NIPR."</p>

<p>A PCI option ROM shouldn't be allowed to write arbitrary stuff to 
SMRAM (in fact I think this is forbidden in the super-complicated UEFI 
SMM architecture). So is DEITYOUNCE, at least to some extent, exploiting
 a vulnerability of the Dell SMM code?</p>

<p>@Paolo, Dell didn't make the switch to UEFI until a little bit after 
that Intel product generation. For a legacy system, there is no spec on 
getting stuff into SMRAM. BIOS could have a single image that gets 
created at built time that it loads then locks the door behind it. 
Others could have modules that add handlers to SMRAM sort of like is 
covered in one of the UEFI PI specs IIRC. Dell likely had a modular 
approach in their BIOS that allowed it to bet exploited like this. The 
exploit code would need to know the 'calling convention' used by the 
functions that load handlers as well as being able to load them. 
Remember that this is all in x86 16 bit assembly so there really aren't 
any standards. The NSA would have had to put in a LOT of hours reverse 
engineering the BIOS and the RAID controller firmware. That's why the 
hardware is so specific fort this malware. But a data center with lots 
of identical servers that carry a lot of traffic would make it a worth 
while effort.</p>

<p>This article seems to assume that all the code being injected runs on
 the x86 side of things, either via Int 13 or SMI, but since the PERCs 
have a programmable RAID controller (that I think was an ARM or 
something non-trivial) is it possible it's actuallly running the code on
 there?  Then it could inject blocks into the hosts memory via boot 
without ever showing any change to the discs, and indeed it might only 
return 'special' versions of the blocks in well defined boot sequences 
and not during a disc examination.<br>Especially on older PCI systems, I assume the RAID controller can DMA interesting bits of RAM without the x86 getting involved.</p>

<p>Jason, offered to give BIOS and PCIe expansion ROM samples. I would 
like to offer them too if there is an easy how to guide. Otherwise, I am
 offering my Toshiba laptops that were interdicted to anyone interested 
in conducting forensics and identifying the implant. IThe implant may be
 similar to BULLDOZER. My email address is bluelotus@openmailbox.org. 
Thanks.</p>

<p>Have been suffering from persistent attacks for 15 months and your 
article was very very helpful. If you still want  samples from BIOS (and
 PCIe expansin ROM also??) - then do advise.</p><p>  1.   If you can tell me how to read the firmware from harddiscs then that would be very helpful.<br>   2. How is best protection against IPMI achieved?  Deleteing it from Windows entirely and remove CMD file - or?</p><p> Kind regards</p>

<p>Thanks for the link Tom. I actually prepared the research on the HDD 
firmware circa mid-2013 but stopped short due to other urgent work. 
There is other way to get to the HDD firmware but it must not be 
corrupted in the first place. Anyway, this BIOS stuff is a weekend kind 
of research since in the college.</p>

<p>I'll be checking in for next article ... the pace of exposition and 
background you provide make it possible for a motivated but initially 
ignorant person to get up to speed in an area that is rarely explained 
well. So thanks again for generous sharing of your knowledge -- the 
internet at its best.</p><p>You are definitely the 'go-to' guy for 
analysis if this stuff is ever located on an actual target computer. 
With the TCP port 32764 affair, online tools quickly showed up that 
allowed people to see if theirs was open. Now we have open source tools 
like ZMap that can scan the entire internet for certain attributes in an
 hour. Just thinking out loud, can we find ways to globally rid the 
world of these implants?</p><p>Here is that amazing tutorial on using 
JTAG to install malicious persistent code on hard drives that I had 
intended to link to above.</p><p><a href="http://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack&amp;page=3" rel="nofollow">http://spritesmods.com/?art=hd...</a></p>

<p>Hi Tom. This article is just the first part. I'll try to cover as 
much and as fast as I can. AFAIK, GodSurge is an entirely different kind
 of attack. There is at least one that is quite similar to this. But, I 
won't spoil the article, because it's the next one in the pipeline :-).</p>

<p>Thank you for this -- an absolutely fantastic article that is very 
clearly written, well-documented and broadly accessible. I posted the 
link over at Bruce Schneier's site (he provides a forum for folks going 
through the ANT catalogue one-by-one). <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/01/" rel="nofollow">https://www.schneier.com/blog/...</a> for DeityBounce.</p><p>I
 wonder though if GodSurge is that similar to DeityBounce, as you 
suggest in the first paragraph. It again is restricted to Dell PowerEdge
 servers but requires a large FluxBabbitt hardware implant and exploits 
the JTAG debugging interface.  The best on JTAG seems to be at  <a href="http://www.alexforencich.com/wiki/en/reverse-engineering/jtag/start" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexforencich.com/w...</a></p><p>The
 other items in the ANT catalog mentioning BIOS are IRONCHEF, SWAP, 
STUCCOMONTANA, SCHOOLMONTANA, SIERRAMONTANA, SOUFFLETROUGH and possibly 
GOURMETTROUGH and FEEDTROUGH</p><p>I hope you are able to take a look at some of these and write additional articles at this depth.</p>
