Of course the invite-only model just made membership more sought after and gained darkode a reputation as an elite underground forum.

Around the time LizardSquad became well known by DDoSing just about anything and everything, they decided to follow the same route as lulzsec(setting up a public IRC channel on freenode), unfortunately freenode was having none of this and and banned them, along with everyone in their channel, a few days later. The same week, LizardSquad had relocated to the darkode IRC, which the darkode admin appears to be fine with, he even allowed LizardSquad to spam the darkode url all-over the internet, something that was previously forbidden.\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOf course, sharing an IRC only implies the darkode admin tolerated LizardSquad but may not have worked with them.
